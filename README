This contains test code for picoboot. A tiny bootloader for microcontrollers.
Actually this is just me experimenting with linking concepts and trying to
build the smallest, featureless, most hacky 'bootloader' possible. Don't pay
attention to this.

Status:
Obviously, not much for now.

How to Build this:
You need the following tools:
* Ninja-build. The project only supports ninja (alas, there's NO makefile)
* arm-none-eabi toolchain is used by build.ninja.
* Any version of these tools will do(I guess).
There are some external dependencies, such as:
  * The STM32 Standard Peripheral Library(SPL) and CMSIS.
  * A linker script for the board at hand(stm32f103rb for now).
  * Read the build.ninja file to know where to place the dependencies.

Build using ninja:
$ ninja
